# Altered DB module

Because there is already enough clutter in top-level directory bruv

## Purpose

This module exists solely for presentation purposes.
It is a standalone unit with code capable of (allegedly):

- generating and running the database from DDL script
- quickly deploying and rebuilding the database in docker
- populating the database
- upgrading the database to one compliant with the new schema
- hand-guide the user through the process
- for now that' it (for now it does nothing of the above)
